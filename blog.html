						<h3><ins>Wildlife & Nature</ins></h3>
						<p>The composition of Madagascar's wildlife reflects the fact that the island has been isolated for about 88 million years. The prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana separated the Madagascar-Antarctica-India landmass from the Africa-South America landmass around 135 million years ago. Madagascar later split from India about 88 million years ago, allowing plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation.</p>

					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>As a result of the island's long isolation from neighboring continents, Madagascar is home to an abundance of plants and animals found nowhere else on Earth. Approximately 90 percent of all plant and animal species found in Madagascar are endemic, including the lemurs (a type of strepsirrhine primate), the carnivorous fossa and many birds. This distinctive ecology has led some ecologists to refer to Madagascar as the "eighth continent", and the island has been classified by Conservation International as a biodiversity hotspot.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>More than 80 percent of Madagascar's 14,883 plant species are found nowhere else in the world, including five plant families. There are several endemic families including the Asteropeiaceae, Sarcolaenaceae and Sphaerosepalaceae. The humid eastern part of the island was formerly covered in rainforest with many palms, ferns and bamboo, although much of this forest has been reduced by human activity. The west has areas of dry deciduous forest with many lianas and with tamarind and baobabs among the dominant trees. Subhumid forest once covered much of the central plateau but grassland is now the dominant vegetation type there.</p>

						<p>The family Didiereaceae, composed of four genera and 11 species, is limited to the spiny forests of southwestern Madagascar.
						Four-fifths of the world's Pachypodium species are endemic to the island. Three-fourths of Madagascar's 860 orchid species are found here alone, as are six of the world's eight baobab species. The island is home to around 170 palm species, three times as many as on all of mainland Africa; 165 of them are endemic.
						Many native plant species are used as herbal remedies for a variety of afflictions. The drugs vinblastine and vincristine, used to treat Hodgkin's disease, leukemia and other cancers, were derived from the Madagascar periwinkle. The traveler's palm, known locally as ravinala and endemic to the eastern rain forests, is highly iconic of Madagascar and is featured in the national emblem as well as the Air Madagascar logo.</p>

						<h3><ins>Reptiles & Amphibians</ins></h3>
						<p>Madagascar has become a model region for testing hypotheses of species diversification and biogeography, and many studies have focused on its diverse and highly endemic herpetofauna. <br>
						We observed species richness of both amphibians and reptiles was highest in the humid rainforest biome of eastern Madagascar, but reptiles also show areas of high richness in the dry and subarid western biomes. In several amphibian subclades, especially within the Mantellidae, species richness peaks in the central eastern geographic regions while in reptiles different subclades differ distinctly in their richness centers. We found that the range sizes of both amphibians and reptiles strongly correlated with body size, and differences between the two groups are explained by the larger body sizes of reptiles.</p>

						<h3><ins>Cultures</ins></h3>
						<p>Madagascar's cultural particularity basically lies on the fact that the country is a place where the Bantu people from Eastern Africa and South-East-Asia once met. The different physiognomies of the various tribes in Madagascar cannot be overlooked. Regarding the Betsileo and Merina tribes, the Indonesian impact is clearly visible in their almond shaped eyes, bright skin and straight hair. As for the other tribes, such as the Tsimihety, Sakalava and Bara, their Bantu origin is recognizable in their curly hair and black skin. The mix of African and Indonesian elements in the Malagasy culture is fascinating.</p>

						<h3><img src="cup4.PNG"></h3>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>The pastoral or nomad culture, a distinct characteristic of the Bara, indicates their African origin. The cult of possession, or Tromba of the Sakalava also has an African origin. What’s more, a lot of agricultural products, such as sorghum, watermelons and onions originated in Africa. On the other hand, many elements such as the rectangular building structure, the rice terraces of the Merina and Betsileo, the forging technology with its air supply by two cylinders, the outriggers of the Vezo tribe, the excessive ancestor worship of almost every tribe and the grave sculptures of the Sakalava, Antandroy and Mahafaly originated in Indonesia. Despite the different ethnic groups in Madagascar, there is one single language on the island. The Malagasy language belongs to the Ma´anyan language family of Western Indonesia.</p>

						<h3><ins>Taboo</ins></h3>
						<p>Fady is the Malagasy word for taboo. In the local language, the word Fady is both an adjective and a noun. The Fady is based on anecdotes and stories, and their roots are hidden in traditional legends and myths. For example, for the Mahafaly tribe living in the South of the island, it is Fady to eat the radiated tortoise. The history behind this Fady is that once, some people from that tribe cooked a tortoise. After a little while, someone looked into the pot, but found out that the heart of the animal was still beating. This made them horrified. This is an example of how a Fady starts. Fady goes hand in hand with the local religion. Pork is often Fady in sacred places. In several sacred sites of Antananarivo, onions and salt are Fady. In the village of Ambohimanga, the summer residence of the former Queens of Antananarivo, pork and chicken are Fady. In the cave of Antakarana, in the Ankarana National Park, it is Fady to speak the Merina language of the Highlands. </p>

						<h3><ins>Circumcision</ins></h3>
						<p>For “Antambahoaka tribe members”, manhood goes hand-in-hand with circumcision. The “Sambatra” festival takes place every seven years in Mananjary, in the south-east coast of Madagascar. It could last up to three months. As the tradition dictates, it must take place on Friday, a day the community considers as a celebration day, and which follows a traditional farming calendar: the Friday year. The renovation of the royal hut marks the beginning of the ritual. Then the village’s fathers would decorate the ridge of a carved dove hut, symbolizing the ark of Noah. The mothers, for their part, would prepare the red outfits of the little boys and weave special mats for this occasion. Then young men would fetch water (in a sacred river) that would be used later to wash the wounds of the circumcised boys. After that, the festival heads towards the mouth of the ‘Pangalanes Canal’, where the core rite takes place and the circumcised boys receive the king’s blessing, marking the ritual passage of Antambahoaka boys to real men. May we remind you that the “Sambatra” festival, as its name suggests, is also an opportunity for the entire community to indulge themselves in feasting.The next “Sambatra” festival will take place in 2021.</p>

						<h3><ins>Spirit possession</ins></h3>
						<p>Alongside the material beauty of the Big Island, Madagascar is also home to a plethora of ancestral practices among which the “Tromba” is worth a closer look. Typical of Sakalava tribe members, this spirit possession ritual usually takes place at rising full moon, during which the diviner, essentially a woman, invokes the spirits or “Tromba” of royal ancestors who once reigned in the southwestern part of the island. The ritual begins with a traditional polyharmonic song accompanied by hands clapping with accordionist providing it some rhythms. Venerated and honored, the invoked spirit manifests its presence by speaking through the mouth of its host, the possessed diviner.</p>
						<p>Burial & Exhumation</p>
						<p>For the Malagasy, the notion of home is connected to the family grave or Fasandrazana. Home is where the family tomb lies. This home is often in the countryside, away from the big city. To be buried in the family tomb has great significance. <br>
							The Malagasy people celebrate exhumation in an effort to praise their ancestors. How many times this festival takes place is up to each family. If the deceased parents appear to a family member in a dream and tell him/her « we are cold », it means that an exhumation is required. The family astrologer is consulted to determine the best days for an exhumation. Often, it takes place in the dry season for practical reasons. The amount of money to spend and the number of guests are decided by the entire family. When all the guests are gathered, everybody, along with musicians from the family village, goes to the family tomb with the new shrouds and mats. <br>The Festival also offers the opportunity for the large family to come together. They then see the future with confidence, because they know that they got the blessing of the ancestors.</p>
